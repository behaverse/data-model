## TBD

what type of values do variables get?

how does indexing work?

how are rows sorted by default?




## Indexing contexts
We use several variables to index particular types of entities. As stated earlier, a context for indexing must be specified. We use the convention illustrated in the figure below:


![Indexing contexts]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/indexing_contexts.png)


The figure above indicates that the largest context is study. subjects of a study are indexed within a study; the first subject has index 1, the second has index 2, etc.

A subject may complete multiple sessions. Within a subject, the first session has index 1 and the second session has index 2, etc.

Timelines are indexed within sessions and subjects. The first timeline in the second session of the third subject has timeline_index = 1.

Blocks are indexed within a timeline. The third block, in the first timeline of the fourth session of the sixth subject has block_index = 3.

Episodes are also indexed within a timeline. This means that the first episode within each timeline has episode_index = 1 and this index continuously increases over the course of a timeline.

Tasks are indexed within blocks; if a block involves multiple tasks, each task will have its own index value.
Trials are indexed within tasks; if a block alternates between two types of tasks (i.e., task_index = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ...], the trial indices might look something like [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, ...].
