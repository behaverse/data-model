# Styleguide

The Behaverse Data Model uses the following conventions:

-   For column names, variables, and functions we use `lower_snake_case`.
-   For enum values (i.e., values of a categorical variables), we also use `lower_snake_case` (because those values might end up becoming columns during the data analysis).
-   For dataset names in code and classes we use `CamelCase`.
-   For named constants we use ALL_CAPS (e.g., `PI`, `MAX_RADIUS`).
