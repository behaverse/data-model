## Naming tasks and their components

Numerous terms designate different aspects of a task. Here we list some of these terms and provide our definition (as for most cases, we did not find clear and consensual definitions in the literature).

job

:   refers to the high level description of the activity the subject is expected to perform. The job is typically described in the instructions (e.g., "your job is to classify these images in one of two categories"). Within job we distinguish `job_type`, which typically takes the form of a verb (e.g., "classify", "sort") and `job_description`, which adds nouns to that verb (e.g., "classify even/odd numbers", "sort by color").

instrument

:   refers to the code or material that is used to present stimuli to subjects and record responses. For example, in questionnaire-based studies, instrument would refer to specific questionnaires (e.g., BISBAS) while in computer-based assessments, it would refer to the specific cognitive test (e.g., NBack). We distinguish `instrument_name` which provides a short name of the instrument (e.g., BISBAS) and `instrument_id` which provides more detailed information about the specific version or instance of that instrument (e.g., BISBAS_v1.2023) which may be linked to additional data about that instrument (e.g., a link to view the instrument) in the *Instruments* table.

    *Note:* a paradigm refers to a family of instruments.

timeline

:   some instruments are not static but rather generate trials based on specific parameters implemented in computer code. We use the term "timeline" to refer to that set of parameters (or configuration file of the instrument). For example, one timeline of the N-back instrument might use N = 3 with letters while another could use the same N-back instrument using N = 2 with digits.

task

:   refers to a particular mapping between a specific stimulus set and a specific response set (and oftentimes an evaluation function which may indicate if that response was correct or incorrect for example). Note that both stimulus and response sets may be empty as in resting state tasks and sometimes only the response set is empty, as when hearing instructions. The definition of a specific task determines the meaning of a "trial" in an experiment and the structure of the resulting data tables.

Note that some instruments require subjects to perform multiple tasks (either simultaneously or sequentially, e.g., the dual N-back test); consequently, a task is not equivalent to instrument.

activity

:   refers to the experience of a subject engaged in an instance of an instrument. For example, a subject that completes questionnaires A, B, A, C completed a total of four activities (despite using only three instruments).

block

:   a timeline may comprise sub-timelines. For example, a timeline may include a practice and two test blocks. We distinguish 4 types of blocks: - instruction - tutorial - practice - test

### Hierarchical structure of an experimental study

Data from experimental behavioral studies typically have a hierarchical structure.

study

:   refers to a meaningful and complete unit of a research project. A study must have a research question and the data collected in a study should be necessary and sufficient to answer that question. A study typically involves many subjects, completing several activities, sometimes over multiple sessions.

session

:   refers to a grouping of consecutive activities. When subjects are tested on multiple days, each such day is typically called a session (i.e., consecutive sessions are typically separated by several hours). Note that there are other more technical and more local definitions of session that are commonly used in computer science. Session in psychology and related fields has a more abstract meaning and is typically related to the experimental design of a study.

activity

:   within a session, subjects complete activities (e.g., complete a computerized test or a questionnaire).

block

:   an activity may comprise multiple blocks that may or may not be of different types. For example, a computerized test may have an instruction block, a tutorial block and multiple test blocks.

trial

:   refers to a particular instance of an experiment (in the probability theoretical sense) where the structure of the experiment is defined by the task. For example, in a particular instance of the 2-back test, a particular trial may involve showing the letters "A-B-A" and observing the response "match". A timeline may combine multiple tasks (e.g., in a task-switching experiment) and for each task, there would be many trials (to support statistical inference).

response

:   refers to the meaningful behavioral unit emitted by a subject on a given trial. The response constitutes the actual observation or behavioral measurement in the dataset.
