## File formats


In general, we recommend using open (e.g., CSV, JSON, .md) rather than closed file format (e.g., .mat, .sav, .docx) to ensure the data is accessible to a wide audience. 

We do NOT recommend to save the same data in multiple output formats to avoid redundancy and version mismatches. Special tools may be developped to convert a dataset from one format to another (e.g., CSV to .sav).
