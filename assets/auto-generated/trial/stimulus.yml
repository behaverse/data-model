- category: identifier
  variables:
  - variable_name: stimulus_id
    data_type: integer
    description: Primary key of the @StimulusTable. Reference to this  identifier
      in other tables are thus named `stimulus_id`.
    range: Each row in this table has a unique `id`.
    notes: If the same stimulus is shown at two different times in a trial, those
      two instances will have their own row in the *<i class="fa fa-table"></i> Stimulus*
      table, each with its own `id`.
- category: context
  variables:
  - variable_name: trial_id
    data_type: integer
    description: Refers to the id in the @TrialTable and indicates in which trial
      this stimulus was shown.
    range: .nan
    notes: .nan
  - variable_name: object_id
    data_type: integer
    description: A stimulus is defined by a set of features. This variable is used
      to identify each time the same stimulus features were used.
    range: .nan
    notes: For example, if the same white digit "3" is shown in a digit span sequence,
      all those instances would have the same `object_id` although they would have
      different `id`s (as they appeared at different times).
  - variable_name: presentation_id
    data_type: integer
    description: In a multitasking setting, a particular instance of a stimulus (e.g.,
      the current letter "A") may be used by multiple tasks at the same time (e.g,
      in the dual N-back task). Because these are different trials, they will have
      different `trial_id` values and hence will have different rows in the @StimulusTable.
      We use `presentation_id` to indicate that a given stimulus is in fact the same
      instance across those trials.
    range: .nan
    notes: .nan
  - variable_name: index_in_trial
    data_type: integer
    description: Refers to individual stimuli within the sequence or set of stimuli
      shown during a trial.
    range: .nan
    notes: .nan
- category: when
  variables:
  - variable_name: onset
    data_type: float
    description: Duration between the start of the trial and the appearance of the
      stimulus (in seconds).
    range: in seconds
    notes: .nan
  - variable_name: duration
    data_type: float
    description: Describes for how long this stimulus was displayed after its onset.
    range: in seconds
    notes: When the stimulus is shown using an animation, `duration` covers the complete
      period between the start of the animation and the end of the animation.
- category: where
  variables:
  - variable_name: panel_id
    data_type: string
    description: Identifier of the panel this stimulus is displayed over.
    range: .nan
    notes: .nan
  - variable_name: x_screen
    data_type: integer
    description: X coordinates of the stimulus on the screen in pixels.
    range: .nan
    notes: .nan
  - variable_name: y_screen
    data_type: integer
    description: Y coordinates of the stimulus on the screen in pixels.
    range: .nan
    notes: .nan
  - variable_name: x_viewport
    data_type: float
    description: X coordinates of the stimulus on the screen expressed as a fraction
      of the screen width.
    range: .nan
    notes: .nan
  - variable_name: y_viewport
    data_type: float
    description: Y coordinates of the stimulus on the screen expressed as a fraction
      of the screen height.
    range: .nan
    notes: .nan
- category: what
  variables:
  - variable_name: description
    data_type: string
    description: A human readable, compact description of the main aspects of the
      stimulus. The description for a given stimulus depends on the task but follows
      a specific template for a given task. Because of this, it looks like the `stimulus_description`
      could be parsed and converted into a more structured format---however, this
      is not the intention; structured parsed data will be available in other tables;
      here, description is for human readability and facilitates the understanding
      of the data.
    range: .nan
    notes: .nan
  - variable_name: source
    data_type: string
    description: Refers to the specific generator or set the stimulus belongs to.
      Stimuli that come from the same source have the same data scheme and could thus
      be described in a table named after `stimulus_source` (i.e., `stimulus_source`
      indicates which table contains the full information about the stimulus; e.g.,
      "digits1to9").
    range: .nan
    notes: We could include a `source_count` variable here that indicates how many
      different stimuli there are in the set; but this is probably better stored in
      the table that contains information about that source.
  - variable_name: source_type
    data_type: enum
    description: A stimulus is typically created using a particular procedure/algorithm
      ("generator") or is sampled from a particular set ("set"). This variable indicates
      which of these two applies for the current stimulus.
    range: '- generator

      - set'
    notes: .nan
  - variable_name: index_in_source
    data_type: integer
    description: When a stimulus is picked from a particular set (e.g., "digits1to9"),
      this index refers to the index within that set.
    range: .nan
    notes: .nan
  - variable_name: role
    data_type: enum
    description: Describe the role this stimulus plays in the trial (e.g., "target").
    range: '- target

      - ....'
    notes: .nan
- category: how
  variables:
  - variable_name: animation
    data_type: string
    description: Describes the animation that was used to show a particular stimulus
      in human-readable format. For example, to refer to a fade-in animation that
      took 3 seconds, we can use "fade-in-3s".
    range: .nan
    notes: .nan
