  variable_name: stimulus_id
  data_type: integer
  description: Primary key of the @StimulusTable. Reference to this  identifier in
    other tables are thus named `stimulus_id`.
  range: Each row in this table has a unique `id`.
  notes: If the same stimulus is shown at two different times in a trial, those two
    instances will have their own row in the *<i class="fa fa-table"></i> Stimulus*
    table, each with its own `id`.

  variable_name: trial_id
  data_type: integer
  description: Refers to the id in the @TrialTable and indicates in which trial this
    stimulus was shown.

  variable_name: object_id
  data_type: integer
  description: A stimulus is defined by a set of features. This variable is used to
    identify each time the same stimulus features were used.
  notes: For example, if the same white digit "3" is shown in a digit span sequence,
    all those instances would have the same `object_id` although they would have different
    `id`s (as they appeared at different times).

  variable_name: presentation_id
  data_type: integer
  description: In a multitasking setting, a particular instance of a stimulus (e.g.,
    the current letter "A") may be used by multiple tasks at the same time (e.g, in
    the dual N-back task). Because these are different trials, they will have different
    `trial_id` values and hence will have different rows in the @StimulusTable. We
    use `presentation_id` to indicate that a given stimulus is in fact the same instance
    across those trials.

  variable_name: index_in_trial
  data_type: integer
  description: Refers to individual stimuli within the sequence or set of stimuli
    shown during a trial.
- categories:
  - when
  variable_name: onset
  data_type: float
  description: Duration between the start of the trial and the appearance of the stimulus
    (in seconds).
  range: in seconds
- categories:
  - when
  variable_name: duration
  data_type: float
  description: Describes for how long this stimulus was displayed after its onset.
  range: in seconds
  notes: When the stimulus is shown using an animation, `duration` covers the complete
    period between the start of the animation and the end of the animation.

  variable_name: description
  data_type: string
  description: A human readable, compact description of the main aspects of the stimulus.
    The description for a given stimulus depends on the task but follows a specific
    template for a given task. Because of this, it looks like the `stimulus_description`
    could be parsed and converted into a more structured format---however, this is
    not the intention; structured parsed data will be available in other tables; here,
    description is for human readability and facilitates the understanding of the
    data.
- categories:
  - what
  variable_name: source
  data_type: string
  description: Refers to the specific generator or set the stimulus belongs to. Stimuli
    that come from the same source have the same data scheme and could thus be described
    in a table named after `stimulus_source` (i.e., `stimulus_source` indicates which
    table contains the full information about the stimulus; e.g., "digits1to9").
  notes: We could include a `source_count` variable here that indicates how many different
    stimuli there are in the set; but this is probably better stored in the table
    that contains information about that source.
- categories:
  - what
  variable_name: source_type
  data_type: enum
  description: A stimulus is typically created using a particular procedure/algorithm
    ("generator") or is sampled from a particular set ("set"). This variable indicates
    which of these two applies for the current stimulus.
  range: '- generator

    - set'

  variable_name: index_in_source
  data_type: integer
  description: When a stimulus is picked from a particular set (e.g., "digits1to9"),
    this index refers to the index within that set.

  variable_name: role
  data_type: enum
  description: Describe the role this stimulus plays in the trial (e.g., "target").

  variable_name: animation
  data_type: string
  description: Describes the animation that was used to show a particular stimulus
    in human-readable format. For example, to refer to a fade-in animation that took
    3 seconds, we can use "fade-in-3s".
