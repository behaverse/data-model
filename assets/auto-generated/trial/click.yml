  variable_name: response_element_index
  data_type: integer
  description: Indicates which of the clicks is used and in what order to form the
    actual response in the response table when `response_structure` is "sequence"
    or "set".
  notes:
  - 'This needs to be here rather than in *<i class="fa fa-table"></i> Option* because
    the same option can be clicked multiple times and either serve or not for the
    response depending on the order of the clicks. For example, in the Digit Span
    test we could have the response of "3;5;7" on a particular trial. This might correspond
    to

    >  - `option.description` = ["3", "4", "delete", "delete", "3", "5", "7", "enter"]

    >  - `click.response_element_index` = [NA, NA, NA, NA, 1, 2, 3,  NA]'
