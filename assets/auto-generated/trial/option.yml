  variable_name: option_id
  data_type: integer
  description: Primary key of the *Option* table.
  range: Each row in this table has a unique `id`.
  notes: If the same option is shown at two different times in a trial, those two
    instances will have their own row in the * Option* table, each with its own `id`.

  description: Refers to the id in the @TrialTable and indicates in which trial this
    option was shown.

  variable_name: object_id
  data_type: integer
  description: An option is defined by a set of features. This variable is used to
    identify each time the same features were used. For example, if the same white
    digit "3" is used as an option in the digit span task, all those instances would
    have the same `object_id` although they would have different `id`s (as they appeared
    at different times).

  variable_name: description
  data_type: string
  description: 'A human readable, compact description of the main aspects of the option.
    The description for a given option depends on the task but follows a specific
    template for a given task. Because of this, it looks like the `option_description`
    could be parsed---however, this is not the intention; structured data will be
    available in other tables; description is for human readability and facilitates
    the understanding of the data.

  variable_name: value
  data_type: float
  description: A numeric value associated with a particular response option; typically
    indicating the "worth" of a response (e.g., `value` = 1 for the correct response).
- categories:
  - what
  variable_name: source
  data_type: string
  description: Refers to the specific generator or set the option belongs to. Options
    that stem from the same source have the same data scheme and could thus be described
    in a table named after `option_source` (i.e., `option_source` indicates which
    table contains the full information about the option; e.g., "digit1to9").
- categories:
  - what
  variable_name: source_type
  data_type: enum
  description: An option is typically created using a particular procedure/algorithm
    ("generator") or is sampled from a particular set ("set"). This variable indicates
    which of these two applies for the current option.
  range: '- generator

  variable_name: index_in_source
  data_type: integer
  description: When a option is picked from a particular set (e.g., "digits1to9"),
    this index refers to the index within that set.

  variable_name: animation
  data_type: string
  description: Describes the animation that was used to show a particular option.
