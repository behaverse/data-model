    instances will have their own row in the * Option* table, each with its own `id`.

  data_type: integer
  description: An option is defined by a set of features. This variable is used to
    identify each time the same features were used. For example, if the same white
    digit "3" is used as an option in the digit span task, all those instances would
    have the same `object_id` although they would have different `id`s (as they appeared
    at different times).

  description: 'A human readable, compact description of the main aspects of the option.
    The description for a given option depends on the task but follows a specific
    template for a given task. Because of this, it looks like the `option_description`
    could be parsed---however, this is not the intention; structured data will be
    available in other tables; description is for human readability and facilitates
    the understanding of the data.
