  variable_name: option_id
  data_type: id
  required: true
  description: Primary key of the @Option table. Reference to this  identifier in
    other tables are thus named `option_id`.
  range: Each row in this table has a unique `id`
  notes:
  - If the same option is shown at two different times in a trial, those two instances
    will have their own row in the * Option* table, each with its own `id`.
- categories:
  - Context
  variable_name: trial_id
  data_type: id
  required: true
  description: Refers to the `id` in the @Trial table and indicates in which trial
    this option was shown.
  range: '`trial_id` in the @Trial table for the same subject/session/activity'

  variable_name: response_id
  data_type: id
  required: false
  description: Refers to the `response_id` in the @Trial table and indicates for which
    response this option was shown.
  range: '`response_id` in the @Trial table of the same subject/activity'

  variable_name: index_in_trial
  data_type: index
  required: false
  description: Indexing each of the options within the set of options that were available
    to subjects on a given trial.
  range: 1-based indices
  notes:
  - If the presented options have no specific temporal or spatial order, leave this
    field empty or assign the same index to all options, e.g., `index_in_trial=1`.

  - Context
  variable_name: object_id
  data_type: string
  required: false
  description: An option is defined by a set of features. This variable is used to
    identify each time the same features were used. For example, if the same white
    digit "3" is used as an option in the Digit Span task, all those instances would
    have the same `object_id` although they would have different `id`s (as they appeared
    at different times).
- categories:
  - When
  variable_name: onset
  data_type: float
  required: true
  description: Duration between the start of the trial and the moment the option was
    displayed or activated, in seconds.
  range: In seconds
- categories:
  - When
  variable_name: duration
  data_type: float
  required: true
  description: How long the option was displayed or active in seconds, starting from
    the `onset`, in seconds.
  range: In seconds

  variable_name: panel_id
  data_type: string
  required: false
  description: Identifier of the pane this option was displayed over.

  - Where
  variable_name: x_screen
  data_type: float
  required: false
  description: X coordinates of the option component on the screen in pixels.
  notes:
  - .important In BDM, the preferred position is the center of the object. However,
    specific implementations of the tasks may use other locations such as the top-left
    corner. If this is the case, it should be explicitly stated in the [codebook](/spec/general/3-dataset-card.qmd).

  variable_name: y_screen

  description: Y coordinates of the option component on the screen in pixels.

  - Where
  variable_name: x_viewport
  data_type: float
  required: false
  description: X coordinates of the option component on the screen expressed as a
    fraction of the screen width.
  range: 0 to 1 (inclusive).

  variable_name: y_viewport

  range: 0 to 1 (inclusive).

  - What
  variable_name: description
  data_type: string
  required: true
  description: A human readable, compact description of the main aspects of the option.
    The description for a given option depends on the task but follows a specific
    template for a given task. Because of this, it looks like the option description
    could be parsed---however, this is not the intention; structured, parsed data
    will be available in other fields; description is for human readability and facilitates
    the understanding of the data.
- categories:
  - What
  variable_name: value
  data_type: float
  required: false
  description: A numeric value associated with a particular response option; typically
    indicating the "worth" of a response (e.g., `value=1` for the correct response).
- categories:
  - What
  variable_name: source
  data_type: string
  required: true
  description: Refers to the specific generator or set from which the option originates.
    Options sharing the same source have the same data structure and can be thus collectively
    described in a table named after `option_source` (e.g., "digit1to9").
  notes:
  - The `option_source` specifies the table or file that provides complete details
    about the option. For instance, `option_source=digit1to9` indicates a source containing
    information on digits 1 to 9.
- categories:
  - What
  variable_name: source_type
  data_type: enum
  required: false
  description: An option is typically created using a particular procedure/algorithm
    or is sampled from a particular set. This variable indicates which of these two
    applies for the current option.
  range: '- `set`: option is sampled from a fixed set of options.

    - `generator`: option is created using a procedure/algorithm.'
- categories:
  - What
  variable_name: index_in_source
  data_type: integer
  required: false
  description: When a option is picked from a particular set (e.g., `digits1to9`),
    this index refers to the index within that set.
- categories:
  - How
  variable_name: animation
  data_type: string
  required: false
  description: Describes the animation used to display a specific option in a human-readable
    format. For example, "fadeIn 3s ease-in-out" indicates a 3-second fade-in animation.
  notes:
  - .tip To maintain clarity and consistency, BDM recommends using CSS-style naming
    conventions for common animations (e.g., "3s linear slide-in").
