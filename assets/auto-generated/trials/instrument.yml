  description: Identifier for a timeline. Timeline is a variant of an instrument with
    specific parametrization, for the whole experiment or for multiple block of trials
    (e.g., "DS_FORWARD" and "DS_BACKWARD" for digit span task). Timelines are configurations
    that specify instrument parameters.

  variable_name: block_id
  required: true
  data_type: string
  description: Specific parameterization of the instrument for a single block of trials
    (e.g., "DS_FORWARD_PRACTICE" and "DS_FOWARD_TEST"). Block-level parameters override
    timeline-level parameters.

  variable_name: name
  required: true
  data_type: string
  description: Name of the toolkit (scene, code, or configuration) that is used to
    collect the data, e.g., "DS"  for a software that runs digit span task in forward
    OR backward order. The specific parameterization of the instrument is defined
    by the "Timeline" (e.g., a variant of instrument called "DS_FORWARD").
