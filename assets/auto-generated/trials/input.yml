  description: Indicates which of the clicks is used and in what order to form the

  range: 1 to `input_count` in the corresponding row of the @Trial table.
  notes:
  - 'This needs to be here rather than in @Option table, because the same option can
    be clicked multiple times and either serve or not for the response depending on
    the order of the clicks. For example, in the Digit Span test we could have the
    response of "3;5;7" on a particular trial. This might correspond to

    >  - `option.description` = ["3", "4", "delete", "delete", "3", "5", "7", "enter"]

    >  - `click.response_element_index` = [NA, NA, NA, NA, 1, 2, 3,  NA]'
