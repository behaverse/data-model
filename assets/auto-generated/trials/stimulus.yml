  variable_name: id
  data_type: PRIMARY KEY
  required: true
  description: Primary key of the @Stimulus table. Reference to this  identifier in
    other tables are thus named `stimulus_id`.
  range: Each row in this table has a unique `id`.
  notes:
  - .tip If the same stimulus is shown at two different times in a trial, those two
    instances will have their own row in the @Stimulus table, each with its own `id`.
  - .important Make sure to refer to this field as `stimulus_id` rather than `id`
    When joining tables. This also applies to all the `id` fields; they are named  `id`
    within their own context/table, but `<context/table>_id` when addressed from other
    tables. For example, `X_id` in a table refers (hence a foreign key) to the `id`
    column in the X table.

  variable_name: trial_id
  data_type: id
  required: false
  description: Refers to the `trial_id` in the @Trial table and indicates in which
    trial this stimulus was shown.

  description: Refers to the `response_id` in the @Trial table and indicates for which

  - Context
  variable_name: object_id
  data_type: string
  required: false
  description: A stimulus is defined by a set of features. This variable is used to
    identify each time the same stimulus features were used.
  notes:
  - .tip For example, if the same white digit "3" is shown in a digit span sequence,
    all those instances would have the same `object_id` although they would have different
    `id`s (as they appeared at different times).
- categories:
  - Context
  variable_name: presentation_id
  data_type: string
  required: false
  description: In a multitasking setting, a particular instance of a stimulus (e.g.,
    the current letter "A") may be used by multiple tasks at the same time (e.g, in
    the dual N-back task). Because these are different trials, they will have different
    `trial_id` values and hence will have different rows in the @StimulusTable. We
    use `presentation_id` to indicate that a given stimulus is in fact the same instance
    across those trials.

  description: Refers to individual stimuli within the sequence or set of stimuli
    shown during a trial.

  variable_name: duration
  data_type: float
  required: true
  description: Describes for how long this stimulus was displayed after its onset,
    in seconds.
  range: In seconds
  notes:
  - .tip When the stimulus is shown using an animation, `duration` covers the complete
    period between the start of the animation and the end of the animation.

  description: Identifier of the panel this stimulus is displayed over.

  - Where
  variable_name: x_screen
  data_type: integer
  required: false
  description: X coordinates of the stimulus on the screen in pixels.
  notes:
  - .important In BDM, the preferred position is the center of the object. However,
    specific implementations of the tasks may use other locations such as the top-left
    corner. If this is the case, it should be explicitly stated in the [codebook](/spec/general/2-dataset-card.qmd).

  - What
  variable_name: description
  data_type: string
  required: true
  description: A human readable, compact description of the main aspects of the stimulus.
    The description for a given stimulus depends on the task but follows a specific
    template for a given task. Because of this, it looks like the `description` could
    be parsed and converted into a more structured format---however, this is not the
    intention; structured data will be available in other tables; here, description
    is for human readability and facilitates the understanding of the data.
- categories:
  - What
  variable_name: source
  data_type: string
  required: true
  description: Refers to the specific generator or set the stimulus belongs to.
  notes:
  - .tip Stimuli that come from the same source have the same data scheme and could
    thus be described in a table named after the `stimulus_source`. `stimulus_source`
    indicates which table contains the full information about the stimulus; e.g.,
    "digits1to9".
  - .tip One could include a `source_count` variable here that indicates how many
    different stimuli there are in the set; but it's better stored in the table that
    contains information about that stimulus source.
- categories:
  - What
  variable_name: source_type
  data_type: enum
  required: false
  description: A stimulus is typically created using a particular procedure/algorithm
    ("generator") or is sampled from a particular set ("set"). This variable indicates
    which of these two applies for the current stimulus.
  range: '- `set`: stimulus is sampled from a fixed set of stimuli.

    - `generator`: "stimulus is created using a procedure/algorithm.

    '

  - What
  variable_name: index_in_source
  data_type: integer
  required: false
  description: When a stimulus is picked from a particular set (e.g., "digits1to9"),
    this index refers to the index within that set.
  notes:
  - '.tip In addition to `index_in_source`, `stimulus_id` can also be used to  look
    up further information about the stimulus in the source. '
- categories:
  - What
  variable_name: role
  data_type: enum
  required: true
  description: Describe the role that  the stimulus plays in the trial, e.g., "target".
  range: '- `target`: A stimulus the agent must process and which should trigger the
    completion of the response (e.g., classify, reach, memorize) if the agent is doing
    the task as intended. In some cases (e.g., in a go/no-go task) the correct response
    to a stimulus is to NOT click the button. In this case, the stimulus that triggered
    the decision to NOT click the button is still a `target`.

    - `non_target`: A stimulus the agent must process but which does not trigger the
    completion of the response (e.g., the first two stimuli in a 2-back test).

    - `distractor`: "A stimulus the agent should not process at all (i.e., ignore)
    and which is unrelated to the correct execution of the task.

    - `location_cue`: A stimulus giving a spatial location information that agents
    could use to improve their performance.

    -  `job_specifier`: A stimulus specifying which job the agent should perform.

    - `stop_signal`: "A stimulus signaling the agents that they should abort current
    action.

    - `probe`: A stimulus indicating about which stimulus to respond.'

  - How
  variable_name: animation
  data_type: string
  required: false
  description: Describes the animation used to display a specific stimulus in a human-readable
    format. For example, "fadeIn 3s" indicates a 3-second fade-in animation.
  notes:
  - .tip To maintain clarity and consistency, BDM recommends using CSS-style naming
    conventions for common animations (e.g., "3s linear slide-in").
