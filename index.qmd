There are increasing amounts of behavioral data freely available on the internet. Metadata standards and semantic web make it easier to find them. However, there are large inconsistencies in the way those datasets are structured, in the way their variables are named, and even in what is meant by various common terms. These inconsistencies make it unnecessarily hard to reuse or combine datasets and hinder the development of effective tools.

The *Behaverse Data Model (BDM)* is an ongoing attempt to define a storage format for behavioral datasets that unifies a wide range of cognitive tests, questionnaires, and instructions. It establishes conventions for structuring behavioral datasets and naming behavioral variables.

### How to use this website

The website is organized as follows:

- [Guides](/guides/index.qmd): Tutorials and how-tos for integrating BDM into your projects.
- [Specifications](/spec/index.qmd): Formal specifications of the BDM datasets.
- [Explanations](/explanations/index.qmd): Detailed explanations of fundamental concepts and design decisions.

You can also check:

- [Datasets](/datasets/index.qmd): Examples of datasets that conform to the BDM.
- [Glossary](/glossary/index.qmd): A controlled vocabulary for behavioral data.
