There are increasing amounts of behavioral data freely available on the internet. Metadata standards make it easier to find them. However, there are large inconsistencies in the way those datasets are structured, in the way their variables are named, and even in what is meant by various common terms. These inconsistencies make it unnecessarily hard to reuse or combine datasets and prevent the development of effective tools.

The *Behaverse Data Model (BDM)* defines a coherent data model for behavioral data which unifies a wide range of cognitive tests and questionnaires. It also establishes guidelines for naming behavioral variables and structuring behavioral datasets.
