There are increasing amounts of cognitive and behavioral data freely available on the internet. Metadata standards and semantic web make it easier to find them. However, there are large inconsistencies in the way those datasets are structured, their variables named, and even in the meaning of various common terms. These inconsistencies make it unnecessarily hard to find and use datasets[^1] and hinder the development of effective tools.

[^1]: Hulsebos, M., Lin, W., Shankar, S., & Parameswaran, A. (2024, June). It took longer than i was expecting: Why is dataset search still so hard?. In *Proceedings of the 2024 Workshop on Human-In-the-Loop Data Analytics* (pp. 1-4). <https://doi.org/10.1145/3665939.3665959>

The *Behaverse Data Model (BDM)* is an ongoing attempt to define a data format for cognitive and behavioral datasets that unifies a wide range of cognitive tests and questionnaires. It establishes conventions for structuring datasets and naming variables.

### How to use this website

The website is organized into three main parts:

- [Guides](/guides/index.qmd): Tutorials and how-tos for integrating BDM into your projects.
- [Specifications](/spec/index.qmd): Formal specifications of the BDM datasets.
- [Explanations](/explanations/index.qmd): Detailed explanations of fundamental concepts and design decisions.

You can also check:

- [Datasets](/datasets/index.qmd): Examples of datasets that conform to the BDM.
- [Glossary](/glossary/index.qmd): A controlled vocabulary for cognitive and behavioral data.

### Evolution of the BDM

To suggest improvements, please read the [design process](explanations/2-design-process.qmd) and visit [discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/behaverse/discussions). Everyone is welcome to [contribute](contribute.qmd).
