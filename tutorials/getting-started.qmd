Behaverse Data Model (BDM for short) is a dataset architecture that aims to provide interoperable data for modern cognitive projects. It is a set of conventions and tools that help you organize your data in a way that is easy to understand and use for both domain experts and technical experts. It is designed to work with a wide range of cognitive tasks and questionnaires.

Whether you're an individual scientist or part of a larger lab, BDM can help you build a dataset that is easy to understand, maintain, and share with others. BDM is opinionated but designed to be flexible and extensible, so you can adapt it to your specific needs out of the box.

## How does a BDM dataset look like?

A BDM dataset is a collection of files and directories that follow a specific structure. Here is an example of a simple BDM dataset:

```{.default .file-tree}
dataset/
├── README.md
├── subjects.csv
├── instruments/
└── beh/
```

The `README.md` file contains both human-readable description and machine-readable metadata of the dataset.

The `subjects.csv` file contains information about the subjects and agents in the dataset. It is a CSV file with one row for each subject and columns for each attribute.

The `instruments/` folder contains parameters for the tasks, instructions, and questionnaires. Each instrument represented as a YAML file that describes the instrument and its parameters. The instrument files are named after the instrument name, e.g., `instruments/NBack.yaml`.

The `beh/` folder contains the behavioral data files. Within this folder, data files are organized as `subject/session/activity/<DATA>.csv`, where each row in the CSV file is indexed by trial, and each column is a variable about the trial.

The `beh/` folder is named after the data types in it (i.e., behavioral data). If your dataset includes additional data types, you can create corresponding folders. For example, you could create a `eeg/` folder to store the EEG data or a `func/` folder to store the fMRI data. See [BIDS data types](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/getting_started/folders_and_files/folders.html#datatype) for a list of supported data types and corresponding folder names.
