Behaverse Data Model (BDM for short) is a dataset architecture that aims to provide interoperable data for modern cognitive projects. It is a set of conventions and tools that help you organize your data in a way that is easy to understand and use for both domain experts and technical experts. It is designed to work with a wide range of cognitive tasks and questionnaires.

Whether you're an individual scientist or part of a larger lab, BDM can help you build a dataset that is easy to understand, maintain, and share with others. BDM is opinionated but designed to be flexible and extensible, so you can adapt it to your specific needs out of the box.

## How does a BDM dataset look like?

A BDM dataset is a collection of files and directories that follow a specific structure. Here is an example of a simple BDM dataset:

```{.default .file-tree}
dataset/
├── README.md
├── subjects.csv
├── instruments/
└── subjects/
```

The `README.md` file contains both human-readable description and machine-readable metadata of the dataset.

The `subjects.csv` file contains information about the subjects and agents in the dataset. It is a CSV file with one row for each subject and columns for each attribute.

The `instruments/` folder contains parameters for the tasks, instructions, and questionnaires. Each instrument represented as a YAML file that describes the instrument and its parameters. The instrument files are named after the instrument name, e.g., `instruments/UFOV.yaml`.

The `subjects/` folder contains the data files. Within this folder, data files are organized as `<SUBJECT>/<SESSION>/<ACTIVITY>/<DATA>`.

This folder also contains additional data for the studyflow, stimuli, and other data types. For example, the `subjects/` folder for a dataset of three subjects, each with two sessions, and each session with two activities might look like this:

```{.default .file-tree}
...
subjects/
├── subject_1/
│   ├── studyflow.csv
│   ├── session_1/
│   │   ├── UFOV/
│   │   │   └── trials_1.csv
│   │   └── DigitSpan/
│   │       └── trials_1.csv
│   └── session_2/
│       ├── UFOV/
│       │   └── trials_1.csv
│       └── DigitSpan/
│           └── trials_1.csv
├── subject_2/
│   ├── studyflow.csv
│   └── session_1/
│       ├── UFOV/
│       │   └── trials_1.csv
│       └── DigitSpan/
│           ├── trials_1.csv
│           ├── trials_2.csv
│           └── trials_3.csv
└── subject_3/
    ├── studyflow.csv
    ├── session_1/
    │   ├── UFOV/
    │   │   └── trials_1.csv
    │   └── DigitSpan/
    │       └── trials_1.csv
    └── session_2/
        ├── UFOV/
        │   └── trials_1.csv
        └── DigitSpan/
            └── trials_1.csv
```

Note that:

- Each subject has a folder named `subject_<ID>` where `<ID>` is a unique identifier for the subject. `<ID>` can be a number or a string, but must be unique within the dataset.
- The `studyflow.csv` file contains the order and metadata of the all activities for the subject.
- Each session has a folder named `session_<ID>` where `<ID>` is a unique identifier for the session. Session identifiers are unique within the dataset, so `session_01` for `subject_01` is the same as `session_01` for `subject_02`.
- Each activity has a folder named `<ACTIVITY>` where `<ACTIVITY>` is the name of the activity. In this example, the activities are `ufov` and `DigitSpan`. For each activity, there is an instrument file in the `instruments/` folder with the same name.
- The `trial_<ATTEMPT>.csv` contains the trial data collected during the activity, where `<ATTEMPT>` is 1-indexed and represents how many times the subject has initiated the activity. For example, `subject_02` has multiple responses for the `DigitSpan` activity in session 1.
- The dataset is in incomplete in terms of having the same data for all subjects. Data for the second subject (`subject_02`) does not include a second session, so there is no `session_02` folder for this subject.
