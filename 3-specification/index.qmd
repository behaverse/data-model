# Specification

## General intro do spec


The L1-data contains multiple tables, some of which are detailed in this document, others will be added in the future.

> We use <i class="fa fa-table"></i> icon to refer to specific tables (e.g., the *<i class="fa fa-table"></i> Trial* table or the *<i class="fa fa-table"></i> Stimulus* table) and **subsections** to indicate the semantic category that groups various columns in a table; these semantic categories are used here only to highlight the ordering of the columns within each table.
