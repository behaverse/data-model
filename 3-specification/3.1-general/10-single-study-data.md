# Organization of standalone single study data

There are different valid options to organize standalone single study data and there are certain rules that apply to all such organizational systems.In particular, any dataset must have 
a document that describes and gives background information about the dataset as a whole (e.g., README.md, licence).

a code book that describes the meaning of the variables and the values they can take. 
Ideally these documents should have a code (hash) that guarantees that they refer to a particular dataset. These elements will be described later.
