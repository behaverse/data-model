Dataset card
: A structured representation of metadata. It is generally defined in the `README.md` front matter of a dataset (see [folder structure](1-folder-structure.qmd)) and provides information about its creator, license, funding, and other relevant information.

Codebook
: Part of the dataset card that contains information about the variables in the data (such as their names, types, and descriptions). It also includes information about the values that each variable can take on and any missing data that may exist in the dataset. The codebook is an essential component of the dataset, as it provides context and semantic that helps researchers interpret the data.

### Derived datasets

Sometimes a dataset is curated/aggregated and shared by people who were not the original collectors of the data. In those cases it might be unclear how exactly to attribute proper credit to each type of contribution.

In BDM, the creator(s) of a dataset are the people or organizations that published that specific version of the dataset, not the people or organizations that collected the data. For instance, if the shared dataset has been processed inadequately, it would not make sense to blame to original data collectors for such mistakes.

This being said, the original data collectors must be appropriately credited. There are 5 mechanisms we recommend

-   name of the dataset refers to original data collectors;
-   description of the dataset states clearly that data collection was performed by other people;
-   citation provides a link to cite the original study
-   creditText provides credit to both the curated and the original versions
-   isBasedOn provides information and links to the original dataset.
