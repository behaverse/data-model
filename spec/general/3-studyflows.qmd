Studyflows are formal diagrams based on BPMN to describe research workflows. They can be used to visually describe the study protocol, data collection, analysis pipeline, or any other steps in a study. Studyflows facilitate communication with participants (e.g., by automatically running a study), researchers (e.g., by reproducible protocols and analyses), systems (e.g., by automated data processing), and other stakeholders.

Here is an example of a simple studyflow:

Although studyflows are visual, the underlying storage format is XML (just like BPMN). This allows studyflows to be easily shared, version-controlled, and processed by machines. Studyflows can be created and executed using diagramming tools such as [Studyflow Modeler](https://behaverse.org/studyflow-modeler).

## Basic elements

Each Studyflow is a BPMN diagram with additional elements specific to research workflows in cognitive sciences.

### Experimental design

The following elements can be used to describe the experimental design and data collection.

`bpmn:StartEvent`
: A starting node where the workflow is initiated. There must be only one start node in a study.

`studyflow:Activity`
: A generic task (`bpmn:Task`) that can be performed by human or computer agents.

`studyflow:Questionnaire`
: When participants are instructed to answer a questionnaire.

`studyflow:Instruction`
: When participant are instructed to read some instructions.

`studyflow:CognitiveTest`
: A computerized program where participants perform a cognitive task.

`studyflow:VideoGame`
: A computer game in which participants play a video game.

`bpmn:EndEvent`
: An ending node that marks where the workflow completes.

For a complete list of supported elements and their attributes, see the [Studyflow ontology](/assets/schemas/studyflow.yaml).


### Data and analysis pipeline

The following elements can be used to describe the collected data and the modeling pipeline.

`bpmn:StartEvent`
: initiates the analysis pipeline.

`bpmn:EndEvent`
: terminates the analysis pipeline.
