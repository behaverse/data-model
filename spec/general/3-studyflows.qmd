Studyflows are BPMN-based diagrams to describe research workflows. They can be used to visually describe the study protocol, data collection, analysis pipeline, or any other steps in a study. Studyflows facilitate communication with participants (e.g., by automatically running a study), researchers (e.g., by reproducible protocols and analyses), systems (e.g., by automated data processing), and other stakeholders.

Here is an example of a simple studyflow:

Although studyflows are visual, the underlying storage format is machine-readable. This allows for automated execution, validation, versioning, and simulation of studyflows. Studyflows can be created using diagramming tools such as [Studyflow Modeler](https://behaverse.org/studyflow-modeler).
