The Behaverse Data Model contains multiple tables, revolving around the concept of a trial. A trial is a single instance of a participant interacting with a behavioral task and contains information about the participant, the task, and the interaction between the two. The trial-related tables are designed to be as flexible as possible, allowing for a wide range of tasks to be represented.

We use <i class="bi bi-table"></i> icon to refer to specific tables (e.g., the *<i class="bi bi-table"></i> Trial* table or the *<i class="bi bi-table"></i> Stimulus* table) and **subsections** to indicate the semantic category that groups various columns in a table; these semantic categories are used here only to highlight the ordering of the columns within each table.
