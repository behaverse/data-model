The Behaverse Data Model contains multiple tables, revolving around the concept of a trial. A trial is a single instance of a participant interacting with a behavioral task and contains information about the participant, the task, and the interaction between the two. The trial-related tables are designed to be as flexible as possible, allowing for a wide range of tasks to be represented.
