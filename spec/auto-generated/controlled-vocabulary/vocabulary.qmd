We will always use `accuracy` to refer to a performance measure that is a float and bounded in the [0-1] range.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 0 to 1 (inclusive).                        | nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| General                 | correct                 | boolean             | `correct` is a boolean variable which indicates for a given trial or response whether it was correct or not. When no response was given when it should (i.e., timeout), correct evaluates to `FALSE` rather than `NA`. This is to avoid the case where people would be given a high performance score when in fact they avoided all difficult trials and responded correctly only to easy trials.                                                                                                                                                                                 | nan                                        | nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| General                 | response_time           | float               | the meaning of `response_time` (and its units) is not consistent across studies. For us, `response_time` is the duration between the moment the participant fully completed their response on a given trial and the moment that the earliest possible correct response could have been completed by an AI agent with perfect knowledge of the task and ability to instantaneously execute the response.                                                                                                                                                                           | nan                                        | Other measures of durations exist and may be useful to describe a person's response. If such additional measures are needed, they should be specified explicitly.

| Demographics            | age                     | float               | `age` is typically expressed in years. However, we don't recommend flooring "age" to get integer values, as flooring implies losing data. It is better to leave variables as floats (when they are floats) and let the analyst decide whether or not flooring this variable is necessary for their specific purpose.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | nan                                        | nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Demographics            | gender/sex              | enum                | gender and sex are not exactly the same. Sex refers to a biological sex while gender is a more complex construct. A person may have a male biological sex but identify as a women for example. Depending on the question asked, the variable should therefore be either `sex` or `gender`. *"What sex were you assigned at birth, such as on an original birth certificate?"* is clearly a question about biological sex and should be coded as `sex`.

When those synonyms are not required (e.g., domain language) they should be avoided and replaced by "type". Not all enums however need to be suffixed with "type".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Suffixes/Aggregation    | quantile*               | float               | quantiles are similar to percentiles; both refer to the value of a variable x that splits the data such that a given fraction of the data is smaller than x. Quantile expresses that fraction as a number between 0 and 1 while percentiles express it as a percentage (between 0 and 100). > We use quantiles rather than percentiles because they allow us to name the resulting variables in a simpler way. We use the following convention:                                                                                                                                   | nan                                        | `quantile(x, q = 1)` can not be expressed using this convention. Note however that `quantile(x, q = 1)` is in fact equivalent to `max(x)` which is the preferred expression.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Referencing             | *_repetition            | integer             | is used to count the number of times the same "thing" occurred (e.g., a participant completes the same test twice, the same stimulus appears multiple times). As with index, repetition assumes a context which must be clarified when ambiguous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | nan                                        | Repetition starts "counting" at 0 rather than 1; *_iteration instead of *_repetition would solve this issue but is less explicit and thus less preferred.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
