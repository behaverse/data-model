| task                | episode_index                  | False      | index       | Refers to a particular time interval, in chronological order, of a subject's participation in a study. Episodes are temporally distinct (no overlap) and discrete. The binning of the time into successive episodes depends on the task; it is mostly used and necessary to group data in cases where two distinct trials occurred at the same time (e.g., dual N-back).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | index of episode within a timeline.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Note that in some cases two different trials may use data from partially different but overlapping episodes. For example, consider the 2-back task with the stimulus sequence A-X-F-X. The first trial involves the stimuli A-X-F and the second trial the sequence X-F-X; these two trials refer in fact to the same instances of stimuli X and F. To clarify that these two trials use overlapping episodes we specify episode_index = “1;2;3” in the first case and episode_index = “2;3;4” in the second case.                                                                                                                                                               |

For example, in the [MOT task](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_object_tracking) one may ask subjects to point to all dots that hide a token.

| response            | response_count                 | False      | integer     | Each trial contains by definition only one response. However, when response_structure is other than unitary, a response comprises multiple pieces of information (e.g., “3-5-7” could be one response in the digit span task and this response contains three components, namely “3”, “5” and “7”). response_count refers to the number of components that make up a response (not the number of responses within a trial).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | nan                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | response_count is different from input_count; a subject may in some cases change their response multiple times before submitting the final response. In such cases, there would be many more inputs than there are components to the final response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| evaluation          | evaluation_label               | False      | enum        | There are several labels that can be assigned to a given response to specify what that response means in terms of evaluation within a task. The most general terms are "correct” and "error" (which are already given by the correct variable). There are however more specific sets of terms that may apply in different contexts. For example, in a signal detection task, it is common to use labels from the signal detection theory framework (i.e., “hit”, “miss”, “false alarm”, “correct rejection”). In other contexts, researchers might use terms like “omission” or “commission” errors or even things like “perseveration” error (e.g., in the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test). Note that these terms are not always well defined or exclusive. For example, a “hit” is also a “correct” response and a “false alarm” may be synonymous to “commission error”.
