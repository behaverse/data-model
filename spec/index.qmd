Behaverse Data Model (BDM) specifies dataset structure and a set of tables that are designed to capture the information relevant to the study of human behavior in many cognitive tests and questionnaires. The tables are designed to be tidy and to capture a wide variety of behavioral experiments.

![A typical [workflow](general/3-studyflows.qmd) in an experimental study. BDM defines the structure of the experimental design (studyflow), raw observations (events), behavioral data (trials), and downstream analyses (derived models)](../assets/bpmn/behavioral_experiments.png){width="80%" .lightbox}

### General

***Part of the BDM is common to all datasets, regardless of the specific type of activity:***

[**Folder structure**](general/1-folder-structure.qmd)
: A BDM dataset is a folder that contains data files and all relevant information needed to make sense of that data.

[**Dataset cards**](general/2-dataset-cards.qmd)
: Contains metadata and information about a dataset. It also includes a codebook to describe the semantics, structure, and format of the data variables.

[**Studyflows**](general/3-studyflows.qmd)
: Describes the study protocol and the sequence of activities that subjects are exposed to.

[**Instructions**](general/4-instructions.qmd)
: Provides additional guidance and help about tasks presented to subjects in a study.

[**Questionnaires**](general/5-questionnaires.qmd)
: Describes the questions presented to subjects and the responses they provide.

### Specific

***Some particular structures are unique to the type of data or activity. There are three [levels of data](../guides/1-getting-started.qmd#levels-of-data):***

[<i class="bi bi-database"></i> Level 1: **Events**](events/index.qmd)
: The raw data that are collected during the experiment. They are the most detailed data and are typically sufficient for reproducing the original experiment.

[<i class="bi bi-database"></i> Level 2: **Trials**](trials/index.qmd)
: At its core, BDM defines trials data that are derived from the events. They are task-specific and typically designed to capture the main features of the scientific experiment.

[<i class="bi bi-database"></i> Level 3: **Statistics & Models**](#)
: Summary statistics, scores, or models that are derived from trials (or raw events). They address research questions or used for downstream analyses.
