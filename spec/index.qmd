Behaverse Data Model (BDM) is a dataset structure designed to capture information relevant to the study of human behavior across a wide range of cognitive tests and questionnaires. It defines a folder structure and a set of tidy tables for organizing data from diverse behavioral experiments.

![A typical [workflow](general/3-studyflows.qmd) in an experimental study. BDM defines the structure of the experimental design (studyflow), raw observations (events), behavioral data (trials), and downstream analyses (derived models)](../assets/bpmn/behavioral_experiments.png){width="80%" .lightbox}

### General

***Part of the BDM is common to all datasets, regardless of the specific type of activity:***

[**Folder structure**](general/1-folder-structure.qmd)
: A BDM dataset is a folder that contains data files and all relevant information needed to make sense of that data.

[**Dataset cards**](general/2-dataset-cards.qmd)
: Contain metadata and information about a dataset. Dataset cards also include a codebook to describe the semantics, structure, and format of the data variables.

[**Studyflows**](general/3-studyflows.qmd)
: Describe the study protocol and the sequence of activities that subjects are exposed to.

[**Instructions**](general/4-instructions.qmd)
: Provide additional guidance and help about tasks presented to subjects in a study.

[**Questionnaires**](general/5-questionnaires.qmd)
: Describe the questions presented to subjects and the responses they provide.

### Specific

***Some particular structures are unique to the type of data or activity. There are three [levels of data](../guides/1-getting-started.qmd#levels-of-data):***

[<i class="bi bi-database"></i> Level 1: **Events**](events/index.qmd)
: The raw data that are collected during the experiment. They are the most detailed data and are typically sufficient for reproducing the original experiment.

[<i class="bi bi-database"></i> Level 2: **Trials**](trials/index.qmd)
: BDM considers trials as the core components of behavioral studies. These are task-specific, derived from event data, and typically designed to capture the main features of the scientific experiment.

[<i class="bi bi-database"></i> Level 3: **Statistics & Models**](#)
: Summary statistics, scores, or models that are derived from trials (or raw events). They address research questions or used for downstream analyses.
