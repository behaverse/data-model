## Introduction

The tables in the BDM are designed to capture the information that is relevant to the study of human behavior in tests and questionnaires. They can be used to capture a wide variety of experiments.

> We use <i class="bi bi-table"></i> icon to refer to specific tables (e.g., the *<i class="bi bi-table"></i> Trial* table or the *<i class="bi bi-table"></i> Stimulus* table) and **subsections** to indicate the semantic category that groups various columns in a table; these semantic categories are used here only to highlight the ordering of the columns within each table.
