Behaverse Data Model (BDM) specifies dataset structure and a set of tables that are designed to capture the information relevant to the study of human behavior in many cognitive tests and questionnaires. The tables are designed to be tidy and to capture a wide variety of behavioral experiments.

### General

***Part of the BDM is common to all datasets, regardless of the specific type of activity. This includes:***

[**<i class="bi bi-dice-1"></i> Folder structure**](general/2-folder-structure.qmd)
: a BDM dataset is a folder that contains data files and all relevant information needed to make sense of that data.

[**<i class="bi bi-dice-1"></i> Dataset Card**](general/3-dataset-card.qmd)
: Metadata provides information about a dataset. It also includes codebook to describe the semantics, structure, and format of the data variables.

[**<i class="bi bi-dice-1"></i> Studyflow**](general/4-studyflow.qmd)
: Study flow describes the sequence of activities in a study.

[**<i class="bi bi-dice-1"></i> Indexing**](general/5-indices.qmd)
: Indices are used to identify and address data records.

[**<i class="bi bi-dice-1"></i> Instructions**](general/6-instructions.qmd)
: Instructions provide additional guidance and help about tasks presented to subjects in a study.

### Specific

***Some particular structures are unique to the type of data or activity. Specifically, BDM defines the following levels of data:***

[**<i class="bi bi-0-square-fill"></i> Events**](events/index.qmd)
: The raw data that are collected during the experiment. They are the most detailed data and are typically sufficient for reproducing the original experiment.

[**<i class="bi bi-1-square-fill"></i> Trials**](trials/index.qmd)
: At its core, BDM defines trials data that are derived from the events. They are task-specific and typically designed to capture the main features of the scientific experiment.

<i class="bi bi-2-square-fill"></i> Models
: The model parameters that are derived from the trial.  They generally address the research questions and are used for downstream data summary, analysis, publication, or visualization.
