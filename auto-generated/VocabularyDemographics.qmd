## general

age	[float]
: `age` is typically expressed in years. However, we don't recommend flooring "age" to get integer values, as flooring implies losing data. It is better to leave variables as floats (when they are floats) and let the analyst decide whether or not flooring this variable is necessary for their specific purpose.





## demographics

gender/sex	[enum]
: gender and sex are not exactly the same. Sex refers to a biological sex while gender is a more complex construct. A person may have a male biological sex but identify as a women for example. Depending on the question asked, the variable should therefore be either `sex` or `gender`. *"What sex were you assigned at birth, such as on an original birth certificate?"* is clearly a question about biological sex and should be coded as `sex`. The possible values for `sex` are:
:  **female:** female (girl, woman).
:  **male:** male (boy, man).
:  **other:** other.
:  **skip question:** prefer not to say.
