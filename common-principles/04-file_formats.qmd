## File formats

In general, we recommend using open (e.g., CSV, JSON, .md) rather than closed file format (e.g., .mat, .sav, .docx) to ensure the data is accessible to a wide audience. More specifically using the followign file formats:


| Data type       | Recommended file type | Conditions                                                                           |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Tabular data    | CSV                   | Always.                                                                              |
| Structured data | JSON                  | For specific machine-focused applications.                                           |
|                 | YAML                  | When human readability and editabiliy matters.                                       |
| Text            | markdown              | Always; except for official, static or administrative documents which may be in PDF. |





We do NOT recommend saving the same data in multiple output formats (e.g., CSV and .sav) to avoid redundancy and version mismatches. Note that many tools already exist that allow the conversion from data format to another.
