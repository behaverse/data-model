title: File Formats
---

In general, open file formats (e.g., `.csv`, `.json`, `.md`) are preferred over proprietary file formats (e.g., `.mat`, `.sav`, `.docx`). Open formats ensure that the data is accessible to a wide audience. Specifically, use the following formats:

| Data Type | Recommended Format | When? |
|------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| Tabular data | CSV | Always |
| Structured data | JSON | For machine-focused applications |
|  | YAML | When human readability and editability matter |
| Text | Markdown | Always, except for official, static, or administrative documents which may be in PDF |

Do NOT save the same data in multiple output formats (e.g., `.csv` and `.sav`) to avoid redundancy and version mismatches. However, lossless data conversion must be used if converting data to other formats.
