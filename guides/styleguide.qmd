For column names, variables, and functions use `lower_snake_case`.

For enum values (i.e., values of a categorical variables), also use `lower_snake_case` (because those values might end up becoming columns during the data analysis).

For dataset names in code and classes use `CamelCase`.

For constants use ALL_CAPS (e.g., `PI`, `MAX_RADIUS`).

In some cases data may be aggregated from multiple different projects, each following their own styles and it might not always be feasible/practical to harmonize them. When in doubt, consult [PEP 8 â€” the Style Guide for Python Code
](https://pep8.org/).
