We welcome contributions to BDM. Here are some ways you can help:

- Contributing **documentation** such as tutorials, guides, and examples to the [BDM repo](https://github.com/behaverse/data-model).
- Contributing **code** to the [Behaverse repos](https://github.com/behaverse). More guidelines are coming soon.
- Contributing **data**. We are always looking for datasets to include in our list of BDM-compatible datasets. If you have a dataset that you would like to contribute or reformat into BDM, please contact us.
